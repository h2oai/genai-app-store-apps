# Use AI to Meal Plan

The **Weekly Meal Planning** app is a custom UI on top of LLMs for a special use case.

Any data scientist or Python developer could build a similar app using open source H2O Wave and H2OGPT!

Anyone who is over planning dinner each week can use this app to automatically generate a 
meal plan based on their family's eating preferences.

Ways that Python developers could easily customize this app:
* Change details and attributes about your eating preferences in the input form
* Edit the text of the prompt in the textbox to add more custom details about your preferences
* Change the complete use case - this template could become an app which helps you draft emails
