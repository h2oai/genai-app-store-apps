# Holiday Bingo

## Overview

The Holiday Bingo Generator is a Python web application built with [H2O Wave](https://wave.h2o.ai) that serves as a user-friendly 
interface for creating personalized Bingo Cards based on free-text descriptions of users' goals. The idea is to 
make the process of tracking and achieving goals more engaging by presenting them in a fun and interactive way. 
Users can generate a printable Bingo Card, hang it on their wall, and mark off accomplished goals as they progress
throughout the year.

You can try the app out yourself for free using your Gmail or Github account at 
https://goals.genai.h2o.ai. 

Developers can use this app as a template of a custom UI on top of any collections 
of data in h2oGPTe. Try making an app with your own special Bingo theme such 
as "Meeting Bullshit Bingo"!

## Features

- **Text-to-Bingo Conversion:** The application leverages a Language Model (LLM) to analyze free-text input and convert it into Bingo card content. The LLM understands your goals and creates a unique Bingo card tailored to your aspirations.

- **Customizable Bingo Cards:** Users have the flexibility to customize their Bingo Cards by editing, adding, or removing goals. The goal is to create a visually appealing card that motivates and inspires.

- **Printable and Shareable:** Once the Bingo Card is generated, users can easily print it out and hang it on their wall. The printable version is designed to be aesthetically pleasing, featuring a clean layout and vibrant colors.

- **Progress Tracking:** The Bingo Card serves as a visual representation of the user's goals. As goals are achieved, users can mark them off directly on the printed card, creating a tangible and satisfying record of progress.

### Deploy

Deploy your app in the H2O AI Cloud. Please note, users of the https://genai.h2o.ai 
Free Trial cannot deploy apps themselves today. Any contributions to this or a new app 
will be reviewed and deployed by the H2O.ai team.

1. Review the `app.toml` and use the h2o admin CLI or admin UI to create any 
necessary App Secrets

2. Import the app and make the visibility Public

3. Run an instance with the ALL_USERS visibility

4. Assign the Alias to the new instance or create and assign an Alias

5. Pause and delete the only instance

6. Delete the old app version

```shell script
echo "Setting variables for this app"
app_name=ai.h2o.wave.bingo_new_years_cards;
app_alias=2024-bingo;

echo "Fetching IDs of previous app version and instance"
old_app_id=$(genai app list --name $app_name -l | awk 'NR==2{print $1}');
old_instance_id=$(genai instance list $old_app_id | awk 'NR==2{print $1}');

echo "Importing and running the new app version"
genai bundle import -v PUBLIC;
new_app_id=$(genai app list --name $app_name -l | awk 'NR==2{print $1}');
new_instance_id=$(genai app run $new_app_id -v ALL_USERS | awk 'NR==1{print $2}');

echo "Assigning the alias to the new app version"
genai admin alias assign $app_alias $new_instance_id True;

echo "Privating the previous app version and instance - do not delete without testing!!"
genai admin app update -v PRIVATE $old_app_id
genai admin instance update -v PRIVATE $old_instance_id
```
