# Use AI to create Cycling Plan

The **Create Cycling Plan** app is a custom UI on top of LLMs for a special use case.

Any data scientist or Python developer could build a similar app using open source H2O Wave and H2OGPT!

Ways that Python developers could easily customize this app:
* Change details and attributes about your eating preferences in the input form
* Edit the text of the prompt in the textbox to add more custom details about your preferences
* Change the complete use case - this template could become an app which helps you draft emails
